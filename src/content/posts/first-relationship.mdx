# **My First Ex-Girlfriend**

As I grow older, I feel like my memories are deteriorating. I want to have a place where I can look back and remember. I also feel like every experience teaches me something different, and writing is a good way to reflect on what I learned. You might find this interesting too. For this, I’m writing about my first ex-girlfriend.

## **How did we meet?**

If you don’t know yet, I grew up in a mid-sized city in Northern Thailand called Chiang Rai. I went to school there until I was 12, but before I left, there was this new thing called Facebook. I don’t even know why, but every kid had Facebook, and I was able to add some of my kindergarten friends.

Fast forward about 10 years. In the summer of 2024, I flew back to Thailand to become a monk (read more here) and also to deal with personal stuff. I was going back and forth between Bangkok and Chiang Rai. While in Chiang Rai I had family, but in Bangkok I didn’t really know anyone.

So me being me, I started scrolling through my Facebook friends and adding any potential friend I could meet up with. One of them was her.

We met up twice. One was just a casual gathering, and the other was to party at Khao San Road and then go to karaoke. Funny story: that night was my last night before my flight. I was drunk, my flight was at 8 a.m., and she took care of me and made sure I got to the airport safely.

I think I fell in love with her then. I liked the way she talked, the way she handled herself, and just her mindset. She’s loyal, kind, and caring. She can talk for hours. Unfortunately, she was dating someone else at the time, so I didn’t think much of it.

And honestly, I didn’t even know when I’d see her again. When I came back to the U.S. for fall semester, I told a bunch of my friends about how I was interested in this person.

## **How did we start talking?**

Fall 2024 went by. The only text I ever sent her was happy birthday and maybe happy new year.

Then came spring 2025. I think during that time I was really locked in, and my confidence was high—about my future and my mindset on things (this would change later). I thought I was ready for something new. I felt prepared to fight and survive. I had confidence in my ability to figure things out.

She had been on my mind for a bit, and as Valentine’s Day got closer, I wanted to send someone flowers. In my head, it couldn’t be anyone else except her.

So I started texting her at the beginning of February, and we texted and called consistently. My friend helped me with the first message, and I was able to get her address and send her roses. That’s when everything really started.

I still remember our first call. She was really pretty. It sounds simple, but it’s true—it made it feel real.

## **What next?**

We kept talking every day—learning more and more about her and her family. She was in law school. The way she spoke, the way she texted me, the way she gave me attention and comfort… it really got me hooked.

To be honest, we didn’t have that much we bonded over in the typical way. It wasn’t like we had a shared hobby or the same interests. But she gave me a kind of comfort and stability that I didn’t realize I was starving for.

We didn’t really define the relationship at first, but in my head I knew it was only us. I was also debating when I should ask her out. During that time, I knew I was going to study abroad, and I thought I could see her in person and ask her out then.

One thing I remember thinking was: if we still keep talking after summer, she’s definitely the one. We even talked about marriage and stuff.

## **Summer**

Fast forward through both of our stressful summers working—it was finally time for me to go back to Thailand. I got on the flight to see her.

It was definitely awkward at first, but then we just talked and talked. I also remember being hella jet-lagged and tired and low energy, but she took care of me.

At some point in Thailand, I asked her out. There wasn’t a planned date or anything—I just asked. I’m not proud of how unplanned it was, but it was real, and she said yes.

We even went to Chiang Rai together to see her family. Her family was really nice. They made me food. They’re pretty rich too, and I could feel that difference, but nobody made it weird. During that time everything felt great.

Then we came back to Bangkok and I got ready to fly to Korea.

## **Korea**

Man, I feel like I don’t even remember much. I just knew everything was going well—until it wasn’t.

For the first two months in Korea, things still felt okay. And then it started slipping.

Over time, I started texting her less and less and calling her less and less. I was worried about the future, and I started thinking about us long-term—me being in the U.S. and her being in Thailand. I kept thinking about ambition and stability, and whether I would be able to take care of her, even though she always said I didn’t need to.

When I get overwhelmed, I don’t talk more—I talk less. I withdraw. In my head, I thought it was temporary, like I could fix myself and come back better.

At the same time, I started noticing doubts I didn’t want to say out loud—ambition, and physical compatibility. Nothing was wrong with her. I was just uncertain, and I didn’t know how to handle uncertainty without turning it into distance.

Around Halloween, she could feel the distance. She asked if I was okay, and I asked if we could talk in three days because I was overwhelmed. We didn’t have one huge fight. I think we both just let it die slowly.

She ended things through text. She said she had been thinking about it, and that lately she felt unsure of her place in my life. It wasn’t that she didn’t want me—it was that my distance made her feel like I didn’t need her, and she thought I deserved someone who fit me better.

I responded with gratitude and an apology. I told her she was more than enough, but I was overwhelmed and confused about what I wanted, and I didn’t want to hurt her. I told her she could reach out if she ever wanted to talk when she was ready.

After that, she never texted me again.

## **The part that didn’t end cleanly**

Even when a relationship ends, it doesn’t always end cleanly. She still had my stuff.

Months later, when I came back to Thailand, I was still following her on Instagram. One day I saw her story—and she was with another guy.

That moment hit something in my body and I spiraled. I told myself I was going to text her for one simple reason: my stuff. But if I’m honest, that wasn’t the full truth. Part of me wanted to talk. Part of me wanted to know how she was doing. Part of me wanted closure. And part of me was jealous.

I started writing a message that was basically my “hurt journal” in text form. Even as I typed it, I could feel the contradiction: I kept saying I didn’t want a response, didn’t want to get her back, didn’t want to make her feel anything… but if that was true, why was I texting at all?

The truth was I wanted relief. I wanted the uncertainty to go away. I wanted to feel better for a moment.

I kept asking myself: was my concern valid or was it self-sabotage? Did it need to end? If we talked, would I finally understand what I felt back then? Why do I still care? Why do I still want to know if she moved on?

And I realized something uncomfortable: sometimes “closure” is just my anxiety trying to reduce uncertainty. Sometimes it’s not love. Sometimes it’s attachment and grief.

So instead of sending everything, I started thinking maybe the message wasn’t for her at all.

Maybe it was just a journal entry.

After that, I left our Instagram Blend. That was my first “okay, I need to stop feeding this” move. And then she texted me—basically telling me to stop.

That message pushed me into guilt. I texted her an apology. Not a “please come back” apology—just me admitting I caused the breakup. Me admitting I didn’t show up right, and that my distance is what killed it.

She responded, and it wasn’t soft, but it was honest. She told me I should focus on myself. She said I shouldn’t be in a relationship if I’m not ready. She said people’s feelings aren’t something to play with. And she told me to let her go.

I told her I wouldn’t contact her again, and that I was sorry for the message I sent after asking for my stuff. I said I wished we could’ve talked once before things ended, but I respect her boundaries. I told her I understand her frustration.

And then she sent the final boundary—the one that made it feel finished: we can’t talk, and she’s trying to be respectful to her future boyfriend.

That was the end.

## **What I learned (so far)**

Looking back, the breakup wasn’t only one moment. It was a pattern.

When I got overwhelmed, I withdrew. In my head, I thought I was protecting both of us. But silence is still communication, and inconsistency still hurts. Long distance can’t survive on vibes alone—you need clarity and structure.

And the hardest lesson: comfort isn’t the same as fit. She gave me love and stability, but I avoided the truth about my doubts, and avoiding the truth turned into distance.

I think she wanted clarity and consistency. I wanted time to figure myself out. But time without reassurance looks like rejection.

And now I’m left with the part that’s hardest to accept: she moved on, and I’m still learning how to.

## **What I regret (and what I wish I did differently)**

I wish I gave her more love instead of saying “I don’t know how.” Looking back, I think I hid behind uncertainty. Like love had to be a perfect feeling before I was allowed to show it. But love is also a choice and a habit—especially in long distance.

I wish I said “I love you” more. Not in some dramatic way. Just more often. More consistently. In the small moments. The kind of steady reassurance that makes someone feel safe.

I wish I talked to her more during hard times instead of disappearing. When I get overwhelmed, I don’t talk more—I talk less. I withdraw. In my head, it’s temporary, like I’ll fix myself and come back better. But from the other side, it probably just felt like she was slowly losing me.

I really wish we set boundaries and structure early—simple stuff that would’ve saved us:

* a weekly catch-up call, no matter what
* a rule that we don’t let things feel “off” for days without naming it
* a way to say “I’m overwhelmed” without it turning into distance
* a plan for what reassurance looks like when life gets hard

Because “time to figure myself out” without communication isn’t neutral. It sends a message, even if I didn’t mean it to.

And I wish I kept her updated on what was going on inside my head. Not just the highlights. Not just when I felt good. The real stuff—my fear about the future, my stress, my doubts, my confusion. She didn’t need me to have everything solved. She just needed to feel like she still had a place in my life while I was struggling.

If I could redo it, I think the simplest thing I would’ve done is this: stay present. Stay honest. Stay consistent.

Because the real tragedy isn’t that we ended.

It’s that I cared, and I still didn’t show up the way I should’ve.
