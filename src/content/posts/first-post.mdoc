  A personal archive of what I’m learning in real time—through books,
  relationships, mistakes, and the messy in-between.

## What will be in my blog?

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

This is where I’ll dump the real stuff—what I’m reading, what I’m learning, what I’m unlearning, and the occasional mistake I’ll probably laugh at later. I’m not trying to be polished here. I just want a place to document my thoughts as they evolve, and to keep track of who I am in this season of life.

You’ll see reflections on books that hit me, lessons from relationships and friendships, and ideas I’m trying to live out (even when I don’t get it right). If anything I write helps you think through your own life a little more clearly, that’s a bonus. Mostly, I’m writing so I don’t forget what this part of my journey felt like.

Glad you’re here.
